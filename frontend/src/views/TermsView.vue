        <p class="subtitle">
          Synapic is a meta search engine that prioritizes user privacy and aggregates data from multiple sources.
          This document explains how your data is processed and protected when using our services.
        </p>

        <div class="section-separator"></div>

        <h2 class="section-title">1. Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
          At Synapic, we take user privacy very seriously. We never share any personal information with third parties. All user preferences and search history are stored locally on your device.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">1.1 Information We Collect</h3>
        <p class="section-text">
          Synapic stores the following data locally to improve user experience:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Search History:</strong> Your recent searches and search types (web, image, video, news, maps) are stored entirely on your device via localStorage. This data is used to provide a personalized experience and can be cleared at any time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Language Preferences:</strong> Your search language and location-based result preferences are saved locally. This ensures you receive more relevant results with each search.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Location Information:</strong> IPInfo and WeatherAPI are used for weather and location-based results. These services determine your approximate location based on your IP address. Your location data is not stored on Synapic servers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>API Requests:</strong> DuckDuckGo and OpenRouter AI services are used for search results. These services are subject to their own privacy policies, and Synapic is not responsible for their data processing practices.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Device ID:</strong> A random device identifier (e.g., apm_123456) is generated and stored locally for internal functionality. This ID is not personally identifiable and never leaves your device.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">1.2 How We Use Your Information</h3>
        <p class="section-text">
          Locally stored data is used solely for the following purposes:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>Providing a personalized search experience (quick access to recent searches).</li>
          <li>Remembering your language and region preferences.</li>
          <li>Displaying weather and location information.</li>
          <li>Maintaining search history for your convenience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="section-text">
          This data is never used for analytics, marketing, or any external purposes.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">1.3 Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p class="section-text">
          Synapic utilizes the following third-party services:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li><strong>DuckDuckGo:</strong> Used for search results. DuckDuckGo is a privacy-focused search engine that doesn't track users.</li>
          <li><strong>OpenRouter AI:</strong> Used for AI-powered responses. Provides access to multiple free AI models including Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek, Gemini, and others.</li>
          <li><strong>WeatherAPI:</strong> Provides weather information based on your location.</li>
          <li><strong>IPInfo:</strong> Used for location detection to provide relevant results and weather data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="section-text">
          These services have their own privacy policies, and Synapic cannot be held responsible for their data processing practices. We recommend reviewing their privacy policies independently.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">1.4 Data Security</h3>
        <p class="section-text">
          Since all user data is stored locally on your device, there is no risk of data transmission to external servers. Your device security is the most important factor for data protection. Clearing your browser cache or uninstalling the application will remove all local data.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">1.5 Cookies and Tracking</h3>
        <p class="section-text">
          Synapic does not use external tracking cookies. Your browser's localStorage mechanism is only used for application functionality (language preferences, search history). This data is not personally identifiable and does not leave your device.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">1.6 Third-Party Links</h3>
        <p class="section-text">
          Search results may contain links to third-party websites. Synapic is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these sites. We strongly recommend reading the privacy policy of every website you visit.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">1.7 Children's Privacy</h3>
        <p class="section-text">
          Synapic inherently protects children's privacy as it does not collect personal information from any age group. However, we recommend that children under 13 use the internet under parental supervision.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">1.8 Data Retention</h3>
        <p class="section-text">
          All data stored in localStorage remains on your device until you manually clear it or uninstall the application. Synapic does not have access to this data and cannot remotely delete or modify it.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">1.9 Policy Changes</h3>
        <p class="section-text">
          We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will take effect immediately upon posting on this page. We recommend checking this page regularly.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">1.10 Contact</h3>
        <p class="section-text">
          If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please contact us: yigitkabak@tuta.io
